# üõ∞Ô∏è Orbital

Tracking satellites has never been this easy.

_üöß Project in WIP_
![Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47084457/218479857-c67fc237-258b-4739-96bd-ba3bf6a6d936.png)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How is it made ?

Data is coming from https://www.space-track.org/.

It uses the [SGP4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_perturbations_models) model to predict satellites position. Every SGP4 calculations are done on a second CPU via [WebWorkers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) thread to avoid lag on the main rendering thread.
It also uses instanced mesh for the 3D object, which helps avoid a ton of GPU draw calls

‚ö†Ô∏è The app runs pretty smoothly on any device but does a lot of calculations in the background which are power-hungry and might drain batteries quickly on mobile devices.
